# Labyrint Spill
## By Christian Fosli, for class dat100 at University of Stavanger

The game loads a text file (see labyrint.txt for an example) into a maze.
The goal of the game is too reach the finish box.

It was a school exercise, primarally to practice making GUI applications,
and reading from text files.
