# HOW TO PLAY

Goal of game is to reach the exit.
In order to move around use arrow keys, or hjkl (like in Vim editor).

To go to the next level, press 'n'.

Note:
* You are not able to move through bushes.
* You are are only able to push one block at a time.
* Red dashed square teleports you to start.
* Purple dashed square teleports you somewhere else.
* If you push a block into a teleporter, the block will vanish.

If you are one of the 10 best players for a given level,
you will be asked to join the ScoreList!

There is a separate scorelist for each level. These are saved as
files in the levels directory. To view the score list, select
levels -> view ScoreList in the menubar
