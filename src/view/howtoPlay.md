# HOW TO PLAY

Goal of game is to reach the exit.
In order to move around use arrow keys, or hjkl (like in Vim editor).

* You are not able to move through bushes.
* You are are only able to push one block at a time.
* Red dashed square teleports you to start.
* Purple dashed square teleports you somewhere else.
If you push a block into a teleporter, the block will vanish.

Note: If a file called 'labyrint.txt' is placed in the same
folder as this program (.jar file), that file will be opened
automatically upon launch.
